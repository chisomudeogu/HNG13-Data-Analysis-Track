# 🚀 My HNG Internship Journey: Stage 0 – Getting Started with Data Analytics

Embarking on the HNG Internship journey has been one of the most exciting steps in my data analytics career so far. Stage 0 marked the official beginning — a chance to roll up my sleeves, explore real data, and apply my skills to a practical business problem using **Microsoft Excel**.

---

## 🎯 Task Objective

The Stage 0 task was designed to introduce interns to the **data analytics workflow** — from sourcing data, cleaning and analyzing it, to presenting meaningful insights clearly and professionally.

We were required to:

* Find a publicly available **Sales, Marketing, or Business** dataset.
* Explore, clean, and analyze the data using Excel only.
* Ask **1–3 research questions**, answer them with evidence, and present our findings in a **10-slide report**.
* Finally, share our project on social media and submit the link for review.

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

For this task, I worked with the popular **Superstore Sales Dataset**, obtained from Kaggle.

The dataset simulates retail business transactions across regions, product categories, and customer segments.

* **Sheets:** Orders, Returns, and People
* **Entries:** 9,994 rows and 21 columns
* **Key Variables:** Order Date, Ship Mode, Region, Category, Sales, Discount, Profit, Customer Segment

Each sheet contained vital details — *Orders* showed all transactions, *Returns* tracked returned orders, and *People* linked regions to managers.

---

## 🔧 Data Cleaning and Preparation

Data cleaning is where real analysis begins!

Using Excel, I performed the following cleaning steps:

* Checked for and removed duplicate rows.
* Replaced missing discount values with **0**.
* Ensured all columns had the correct data types (dates, numbers, text).
* Created a new calculated column:
  **Delivery Days = Ship Date – Order Date**


These steps helped prepare the dataset for reliable analysis.

## ❓ Research Questions

I developed five business-focused questions to guide my analysis:

1️⃣ Which region generated the highest sales overall?
2️⃣ How does discount affect average profit?
3️⃣ Which product category and sub-category generate the highest profit?
4️⃣ Which shipping mode leads to the fastest delivery time?
5️⃣ Which customer segment contributes the most to total sales?

---

## 📊 Analysis and Key Findings

### 1. **Regional Sales Performance**

Using Pivot Tables, I found that the **West** region recorded the highest total sales. This indicates a strong customer base and sales activity in that area.

---

### 2. **Discount vs. Profit**

Grouping discounts into ranges revealed that **higher discounts led to lower profit margins**. The more discounts given, the less profit made — a classic business trade-off.

---

### 3. **Product Profitability**

The **Technology/Copiers** stood out as the most profitable, while **Furniture/Tables** contributed the least. This insight highlights where the company should focus to maximize returns.

---

### 4. **Delivery Time Efficiency**

By calculating delivery days, I discovered that **Same Day** shipping mode had the fastest delivery time, proving most efficient for customers seeking speed.

---

### 5. **Customer Segment Sales**

Among customer segments, **consumer segment** contributed the most to total sales, followed by **corporate**. This suggests where to focus marketing efforts for sustained growth.

---

## 💡 Insights Summary

* The **West** region leads in sales.
* Discounts negatively impact profit.
* **Technology/Copiers** generates the highest profit.
* **Same Day delivery mode** delivers the quickest.
* **Consumer segment** drives the most revenue.

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used

* **Microsoft Excel:** for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
* **Canva:** for presentation design.

---

## 🚧 Limitations and Future Work

While the dataset was rich and insightful, it had some limitations:

* Limited timeframe — doesn’t capture long-term trends.
* Some missing or incomplete records.
* Focused on one business domain.

In future stages, I plan to:

* Use **Power BI** for more interactive visualizations.
* Apply **statistical or predictive analysis** to uncover deeper insights.
* Explore **data storytelling** techniques for business reporting.

---

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

Completing Stage 0 was both challenging and rewarding. It reminded me that data analytics is not just about numbers — it’s about uncovering stories that drive business decisions.

I’m proud to have made it to **Stage 1** and can’t wait to build on this foundation as the HNG Internship progresses.
