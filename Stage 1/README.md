### 🎬 HNG Internship Stage 1: Exploring Movie Ratings with Data Analytics

I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully completed my **Stage 1 task** in the **HNG Internship** — and what a journey it has been! 🚀

For this stage, I worked on a **Movie Ratings Analysis Project**, exploring patterns, user behaviors, and rating trends using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**.

Here’s a glimpse of what I discovered 👇
📊 Most users tend to rate movies on the higher end, with an average rating of around **3.5**.
🎥 Movies like *Forrest Gump*, *The Shawshank Redemption*, and *Pulp Fiction* had the **highest number of ratings**, showing how popular these classics remain.
⭐ *The Shawshank Redemption*, *The Godfather*, and *Fight Club* stood out with **the highest average ratings** — clear audience favorites.
🕰️ There was a sharp rise in movie ratings activity around **the year 2000**, possibly due to the rise of online platforms and changing viewing habits.
🎭 Interestingly, **multi-genre movies** tend to earn higher ratings, suggesting they appeal to a wider range of viewers.
🎞️ Films from the **1940s–1960s** received some of the **highest average ratings**, proving that true classics never fade!

Beyond the insights, this project helped me sharpen my skills in **data cleaning, feature engineering, and storytelling with data** — all essential steps in building effective **recommendation systems**.
